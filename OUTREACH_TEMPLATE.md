My name is [NAME], and I'm writing you on behalf of the RustBridge program. RustBridge is an inclusive and accessible event designed to teach newcomers to systems programming and programming in general about the programming language Rust. We, the [LOCAL ORGANIZING GROUP], are interested in reaching more learners, and would like to collaborate with your university to perhaps host an event for your students.

The reason why we think the RustBridge would work in your university is because RustBridge, and other similar programs, like RubyBridge and NodeTogether, have proven to be especially effective around learners who come from a diverse and non-traditional background. We have organized RustBridge events at universities before, like [insert universities here], and we think that it would be a great fit for your university as well.

The event that we are proposing would be an all-day event

We hope you will consider our proposal! Thank you so much for your time, we hope to hear from you soon.
